Challenge Description

>One of our challenge authors shared the post from our event page on Facebook just 12 hours before his presentation. Can you exfiltrate the flag from what he shared?

I just happened to have seen Binit share this [post](https://www.facebook.com/InternetHeroBINIT/posts/1306227643070983).
Checking the post and its comments there was no sign of flag.
Then I checked the edit history of the post and found the flag.
