## Challenge Description

There is a place [Anonymous blog](http://nicehellonice-env.eba-p2umpa4t.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/), people say you cannot share link there because it's their policy. They say sharing link leads to many security issues, though I think it's just opposite based on their specific context(their new feature)

Can you think out of the box?<br>

## Challenge Hints

- Check `/robots.txt` maybe, there's some lead.

## Further Notes

*The URL to the Elastic Beanstalk environment given in the Challenge Description wouldn't up forever; it will be taken down few days after the CTF is ended, and after the participants complete their write-ups. However, you can still figure out the methodology to solve this challenge by going through the write-ups from participants.*
